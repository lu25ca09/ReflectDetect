Analysing a java project:
\n1: Place your jar to be analyzed in your preferred Directory
\n2: Start ReflectDetect with the path to your project as the program argument
\n3: The result.txt will be created inside the directory "results" wherever ReflectDetect is located. The directory "results" will be created if it does not exist already
